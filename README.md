# Financial Dashboard
This is a financial dashboard that has some neat extensive user interface features, and speaking of features, let's get right into it!

## Features
âœ…  -   Fully Responsive & Rich User Interface and Experience Design
ðŸŒ™  -   Dark Mode
ðŸ””  -   Notifications
ðŸ“ˆ  -   Chart & Financial Data
ðŸ”Ž  -   Instant Searching and Pagination Feature

## Conclusion and Personal Take on this project
-- I coded this with pure HTML, CSS, and JS
-- For the chart functionality, I used ChartJS for charting framework
-- I stored the dummy data on a JSON variable, which you can find inside the <script></script> tags...
-- This won't be possible with the help of my senpai and ChatGPT...
-- Soon, I will make this in a ReactJS version!
